**Representatives:**
Your role as a representative will take approximately 5-8 hours a week. This time will be spent across various meetings with your majorâ€™s deans, chairs, or other administrators, meeting with other Senators in various committees, sitting in office hours, and other initiatives such as volunteering at Senate events (internal service hours provided). Additionally, you will be able to vote on major Senate decisions.

In order to be eligible to run you must:

- Be an undergraduate student
- Have a 2.5 GPA or higher
- Be in the major, college, or community of the position you applied for

**Student-at-Large:**
A student-at-large serves on a Senate committee and helps in Senate-led initiatives without having to attend weekly general body meetings. Their responsibilities include attending the weekly meeting of the committee to which they are approved to join and fulfilling any responsibilities delegated to them by the committee (internal service hours provided). Your role as a student-at-large will take approximately 1-2 hours a week.
